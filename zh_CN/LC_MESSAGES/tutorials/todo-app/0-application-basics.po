"Route handlers tell your Litestar application what to do when it gets a "
"request. They are named this way because they typically handle a single URL "
"path (or *route*), which is the part of the URL that's specific to your "
"application. In our current example, the only route handler we have is for "
"``hello_world``, and it is using the ``/`` path."

#: ../../../tutorials/todo-app/0-application-basics.rst:53

"For example, if your application has a route for handling requests to the ``/"
"home`` URL path, you would create a route handler function that would be "
"called when a request to that path is received."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorials/todo-app/0-application-basics.rst:57
msgid ""
"The first argument to the route handler is the *path*, which in this example "
"has been set to ``/``. This means that the function ``hello_world`` will be "
"called when a request is being made to the ``/`` path of your application. "
"The name of the handler decorator - ``get`` - refers to the HTTP method to "
"which you want to respond. Using ``get`` tells Litestar that you only want "
"to use this function when a ``GET`` request is being made."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorials/todo-app/0-application-basics.rst:72
msgid ""
"The syntax used in this example (the ``@get`` notation) is called a "
"decorator. It's a function that takes another function as its argument (in "
"this case ``hello_world``) and replaces it with the return value of the "
"decorator function. Without the decorator, the example would look like this:"
