"This tutorial is intended to familiarize you with the basic concepts of "
"Litestar's Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). It is assumed that you are already "
"familiar with Litestar and fundamental concepts such as route handlers. If "
"not, it is recommended to first follow the `Developing a basic TODO "
"application <../todo-app>`_ tutorial."

"In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of modelling a simple "

"The function called ``get_person`` that is decorated with :class:`@get() "
"<litestar.handlers.get>` is a route handler with path ``/person/{name:str}"
"``, that serves `GET <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/"
"Methods/GET>`_ requests. In the path, ``{name:str}`` represents a path "
"parameter called ``name`` with a string type. The route handler receives the "
"name from the path parameter and returns a ``Person`` object."
