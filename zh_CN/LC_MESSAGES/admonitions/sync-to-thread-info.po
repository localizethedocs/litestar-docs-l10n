"Both synchronous and asynchronous callables are supported. One important "
"aspect of this is that using a synchronous function which perform blocking "
"operations, such as I/O or computationally intensive tasks, can potentially "
"block the main thread running the event loop, and in turn block the whole "
"application."

"To mitigate this, the ``sync_to_thread`` parameter can be set to ``True``, "
"which will result in the function being run in a thread pool."

"If a synchronous function is non-blocking, setting ``sync_to_thread`` to "
"``False`` will tell Litestar that the user is sure about its behavior and "
"the function can be treated as non-blocking."

"If a synchronous function is passed, without setting an explicit "
