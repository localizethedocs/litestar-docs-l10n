"Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package your "
"application and all its dependencies together. It is useful for creating "
"consistent environments for your application to run in, irrespective of the "
"host system and its own configuration or dependencies - which is especially "
"helpful in preventing dependency conflicts."
