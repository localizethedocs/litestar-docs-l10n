"The :class:`DTOConfig <litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig>` class is used to "

"The :class:`DataclassDTO <litestar.dto.dataclass_dto.DataclassDTO>` class is "
"a factory class that specializes in creating DTOs from dataclasses. It is "
"also a :class:`Generic <typing.Generic>` class, which means that it accepts "
"a type parameter. When we provide a type parameter to a generic class it "
"makes that class a specialized version of the generic class. In this case, "
"we create a DTO type that specializes in transferring data to and from "
"instances of the ``Person`` class (``DataclassDTO[Person]``)."

"It is not necessary to subclass ``DataclassDTO`` to create a specialized DTO "

"configuration object, as well as specialize the type."
