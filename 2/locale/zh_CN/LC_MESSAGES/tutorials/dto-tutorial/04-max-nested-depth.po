"Given that we didn't explicitly exclude it from the response, each of the "
"``Person`` objects in the ``children`` collection should have an empty "
"``children`` collection. The reason they do not is due to :attr:"
"`max_nested_depth <litestar.dto.config.DTOConfig.max_nested_depth>` and its "
"default value of ``1``."

msgid ""
"The ``max_nested_depth`` attribute is used to limit the depth of nested "
"objects that are included in the response. In this case, the ``Person`` "
"object has a ``children`` collection, which is a collection of nested "
"``Person`` objects, so this represents a nested depth of 1. The ``children`` "
"collections of the items in the ``Person.children`` collection are at a 2nd "
"level of nesting, and so are excluded due to the default value of "
"``max_nested_depth``."
