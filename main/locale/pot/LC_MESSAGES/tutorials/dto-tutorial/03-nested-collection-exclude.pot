"In Python, generic types can accept one or more type parameters (types that "
"are enclosed in square brackets). This pattern is often seen when "
"representing a collection of some type, such as ``List[Person]``, where "
"``List`` is a generic container type, and ``Person`` specializes the "
"contents of the collection to contain only instances of the ``Person`` class."

"Given a generic type, with an arbitrary number of type parameters (e.g., "
"``GenericType[Type0, Type1, ..., TypeN]``), we use the index of the type "
"parameter to indicate which type the exclusion should refer to. For example, "
"``a.0.b``, excludes the ``b`` field from the first type parameter of ``a``, "
"``a.1.b`` excludes the ``b`` field from the second type parameter of ``a``, "
"and so on."
