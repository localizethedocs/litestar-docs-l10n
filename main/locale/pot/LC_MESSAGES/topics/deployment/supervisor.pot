"``supervisor`` is a process control system for Linux, which allows you to "
"monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems. It "
"is particularly useful for managing processes that need to be running "
"continuously, and for monitoring and controlling processes that are running "
"in the background."

"``supervisor`` is ideal for managing Python web applications that need "
"continuous uptime and robust process control. It's particularly useful when "
"you need extensive process management, monitoring, log management, and "
"customized control over the start, stop, and restart of application "
"processes."
