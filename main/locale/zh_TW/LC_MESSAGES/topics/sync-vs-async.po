"In the context of asynchronous programming, the terms *blocking* and *non-"
"blocking* are often used to describe a particular quality of a function: "
"Blocking the flow of execution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../topics/sync-vs-async.rst:23
msgid ""
"Asynchronous functions are not inherently non-blocking. What they do instead "
"is allow a programmer to control exactly *where* they unblock and return "
"control to the main loop, allowing other asynchronous tasks to run, which is "
"usually indicated by the use of the ``await`` keyword.  This is a very "
"important aspect to note, since an async function that never calls ``await`` "
"and, for example, performs a computationally intensive task, *will* block "
"the main thread for its entire runtime, just like a synchronous function "
"would. More importantly, anything that happens inside an asynchronous "
"function *between* the parts where it waits will also be blocked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../topics/sync-vs-async.rst:32
msgid ""
"Technically speaking, this means that there are no non-blocking functions in "
"Python, since async functions only \"unblock\" at each ``await``. As this is "
"not a useful definition of the term, \"blocking\" usually refers to "
"callables that *block for a long time*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../topics/sync-vs-async.rst:39
msgid ""
"Since \"blocking\" is about the flow of execution, one might think of "
"``await`` as blocking as well; the execution will not proceed past it until "
"the awaitable has been resolved, which fits the definition of the term. "
"However, since at the same time *other parts of the program* (more "
"precisely, other coroutines which had given up control at an ``await`` that "
"has since completed) are allowed to proceed, this is not considered blocking "
"and usually referred to as \"waiting\"."

"Another important aspect to consider when trying to determine whether a "
"function should be asynchronous or not is *why* it might block. In general, "

msgid "I/O bound"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../topics/sync-vs-async.rst:55
msgid ""
"Calls to the file system or network are typical examples of I/O-bound "
"blocking. Their execution speed is largely limited by the time it takes for "
"the external resource to complete, which makes them \"bound\" to that "
"resource."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../topics/sync-vs-async.rst:59
msgid ""
"They are a good fit for async because most of the time is spent waiting for "
"these operations to complete. This means that other tasks can be executed "
"during this time, \"waiting in parallel\", greatly reducing the overall "
"runtime."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Operations that do not wait on I/O can be usually considered CPU bound. "
"Since they don't wait for external resources, their execution speed is bound "
"to the CPU, i.e. how fast it can execute the instructions given."

"They do not benefit from asynchronous execution like I/O bound tasks, since "

"In some cases, CPU bound tasks can be made asynchronous, by introducing "
"points for the event loop to switch to other tasks. An example of this would "

"the beginning of each iteration."

"Asynchronous functions should be used when they can benefit from a "
"concurrent execution, that is, they themselves perform asynchronous "
"operations, such as calling other asynchronous functions or iterating "
"asynchronously, and do not perform any blocking operations, such as calling "
"synchronous functions that are I/O bound."

"It might be tempting to look at this and think a function should be async by "
"default, unless it's performing blocking operations synchronously, but this "
"is not the case. Async itself has an overhead attached to it which, while "
"very small, can in some situations become non negligible. A synchronous "
"function performing non-blocking operations will outperform an asynchronous "
"function doing the same."

"As an inverse of the previous paragraph, it follows that synchronous "
