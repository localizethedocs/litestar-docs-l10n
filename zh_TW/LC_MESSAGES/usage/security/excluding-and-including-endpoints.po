"There are multiple ways for including or excluding endpoints in the "
"authentication flow. The default rules are configured in the ``Auth`` object "
"used (subclass of :class:`~.security.base.AbstractSecurityConfig`). The "
"examples below use :class:`~.security.session_auth.auth.SessionAuth` but it "
"is the same for :class:`~.security.jwt.auth.JWTAuth` and :class:`~.security."

"The ``exclude`` argument takes a :class:`string <str>` or :class:`list` of :"
"class:`strings <str>` that are interpreted as regex patterns. For example, "
"the configuration below would apply authentication to all endpoints except "
"those where the route starts with ``/login``, ``/signup``, or ``/schema``. "
"Thus, one does not have to exclude ``/schema/swagger`` as well - it is "
"included in the ``/schema`` pattern."
