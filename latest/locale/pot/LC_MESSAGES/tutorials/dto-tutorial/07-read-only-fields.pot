"In this adjustment, we add an ``id`` field to the ``Person`` model. We also "

"The ``WriteDTO`` class is assigned to the handler via the ``dto`` kwarg "

"What's happening? The DTO is trying to construct an instance of the "
"``Person`` model but we have excluded the ``id`` field from the accepted "
"client data. The ``id`` field is required by the ``Person`` model, so the "
"model constructor raises an error."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../tutorials/dto-tutorial/07-read-only-fields.rst:29
msgid ""
"There is more than one way to address this issue, for example we could "
"assign a default value to the ``id`` field and overwrite the default in the "
"handler, or we could create an entirely separate model that has no ``id`` "
"field, and transfer the data from that to the ``Person`` model in the "
"handler. However, Litestar has a built-in solution for this: :class:`DTOData "
"<litestar.dto.data_structures.DTOData>`."
